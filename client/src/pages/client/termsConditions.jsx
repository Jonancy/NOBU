            <p>
              Our website is a third-party platform that allows hotels, resorts,
              and other accommodation providers ("Vendors") to list and offer
              their properties for booking by users ("Customers"). We do not
              own, operate, or manage any of the properties listed on our site.
              We simply provide the platform for Vendors to advertise and for
              Customers to search, compare, and book accommodations.

            <p>
              All information about hotel listings, room types, availability,
              pricing, and policies are provided by the Vendors themselves. We
              do not independently verify this information and are not
              responsible for its accuracy or completeness. Customers should
              review all listing details carefully before making a booking.

            <p>
              Bookings and payments are processed directly between the Customer
              and the Vendor. We facilitate the booking process but do not
              handle any financial transactions. All sales, refunds, and
              customer service inquiries must be directed to the Vendor.

              for complying with the Vendor's policies, rules, and instructions
              during their stay.
